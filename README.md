The idea behind this project is like the github of knowledge, groups of like minded interest can get involved with mentors who then set out to work on projects together under an arrangement. Outsiders can then leave comments as if it was a youtube video, and the mentor who is working on the project can work with his mentee and execute a plan, from there everything is set up like a team building project, each project will have it's own goal. Everyone will work together to vote on what and how the goal can be met. Those on the team should consider themselves teacher, student and scholar.
